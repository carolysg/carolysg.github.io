			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p><span class="image right no-overlay"><img src="images/thumbs/investidores.png" alt=""></span>
				This is the final project for the Programming Techniques I module of the Ada Tech - LM Tech Data Talents course.
				<br></p>
			<p>
				The project involves analyzing data about investors. <br>
				There are three CSV files: one with investor information and two with investment data, as shown below:
			</p>
			<ul>
				Investor Registration (investor characteristics):
				<li>id: Investor's ID</li>
				<li>Nome: Investor's full name</li>
				<li>Sexo: Female or male</li>
				<li>Nasc: Date of birth</li>
				<li>Idade: Investor's age</li>
				<li>Email: Investor's email</li>
				<li>Lat_long: Geographic data of the investor</li>
				<li>Job: Investor's or guardian's profession (in English)</li>
				<li>Estado: State of residence</li>
				<br>
				Investment Data (investment characteristics):
				<li>id: Investor's ID</li>
				<li>Salario: Investor's or guardian's income</li>
				<li>Perfil: Investment profile</li>
				<li>Ativo01, Ativo02, Ativo03, Ativo04, Ativo05, Ativo06, Ativo07: Amount of money the investor put in each asset</li>
				<li>Nota1, Nota2: Investor's satisfaction ratings with our company (two evaluations)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The project was carried out in a group (3 people), and the team members can be found in the GitHub repository.</p>


			<h2>Initial steps</h2>
			<p>
				The first step was to import the necessary libraries, open the CSV files, and check the data.
			</p>
			<p>Registration file:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_01.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>Investment file 1:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_02.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>Investment file 2:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_03.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				The investment datasets were concatenated and duplicate rows were removed, resulting in a dataframe with 38,754 rows and 12 columns:
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_04.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				Then, the registration dataframe was also concatenated with the investment dataframe using the “id” key. This made the analysis easier by working with a single dataframe. Before starting the actual analysis, we checked for missing data in the dataframe.
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_05.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				The handling of missing values followed this logic:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For the asset columns (Ativo01 to Ativo07), missing values were replaced with zero, since an investment of R$0.00 is essentially the same as not investing in that asset.</li>
				<li>For the ratings (Nota1 and Nota2), if at least one of the ratings was given, the given ratings from the other evaluation by the same participant were used to fill in the gaps.</li>
				<li>If both ratings were missing, the missing values were replaced with the mean of each rating from the other participants.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> In this way, all missing values were filled in. </p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_06.png" alt="" /></span>

			<h2>Data manipulation and exploratory analysis</h2>
			<p>
				To better understand the behavior of the data, a description of the numerical variables was conducted:
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_07.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				After all the changes, the final dataframe had the following structure:
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_08.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				From here, some manipulations were made to explore the data and improve understanding:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creation of the "Total" column with the sum of all asset values for each investor.</li>
				<li>Creation of the "Média" column with the average of ratings 1 and 2.</li>
				<li>Creation of the "Domínio" column with the email domain of each investor.</li>
				<li>Renaming the "Salário" column to "Renda" and changing its type to numeric.</li>
				<li>Changing the values in the "Sexo" column to "Masculino" and "Feminino".</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_09.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				The "Média" column was then converted to an integer, and a new column, "NPS," was created. This column indicates whether the investor is a promoter, neutral, or detractor, based on the following rules:
			</p> 
			<p>
			<span class="image no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_10.png" alt="" /></span></p>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Promoter: average rating greater than or equal to 80.</li>
				<li>Neutral: average rating between 50 and 79.</li>
				<li>Detractor: average rating below 50.</li>
			</ul></p>

			<h2>Data analysis</h2>
			<p>
				To conduct a data analysis, some questions were answered:
			</p>
			<li>What is the total amount invested in each asset?</li>
			<p>Asset 4 had the highest total investment value, while asset 7 had the lowest.</p>
			<span class="image no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_11.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<li>What is the lowest investment in each asset?</li>
			<p>For assets 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the lowest investment was R$ 0. For asset 7, the lowest investment was R$ 462.93.</p>
			<span class="image no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_12.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<li>What is the average investment value in each asset?</li>
			<p>Asset 4 had the highest average investment (R$ 10,505), while asset 7 had the lowest (R$ 500).</p>
			<span class="image no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_13.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<li>What is the age of the oldest investor?</li>
			<p>The oldest investor is 51 years old.</p>
			<li>How many investors are promoters? And how many are female?</li>
			<p>There are 3,669 promoters. There are 19,385 female investors.</p>
			<li>How many female investors are over 25 years old and invested less than R$ 10,000?</li>
			<p>442 investors are female, over 25 years old, and invested less than R$ 10,000.</p>
			<li>What is the total amount invested by each state?</li>
			<span class="image no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/investidores/02_14.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p></p>
			<li>How are investors distributed among promoters, detractors, and neutrals?</li>
			<p>Investors are divided into 3,669 promoters, 15,477 neutrals, and 19,608 detractors.</p>
