			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/thumbs/steam.png" alt=""></span>
				This is the final project for the Database I module of the Ada Tech - LM Tech Data Talents course.
			</p>
			<p>
				The project used a dataset with information about Steam games, obtained from Kaggle.
				Three different tables were used: games, users, and recommendations.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Games: app_id, title, date_release, win, mac, linux, rating, positive_ratio, user_reviews, price_final</li>
				<li>Users: user_id, products, reviews</li>
				<li>Recommendations: app_id, date, is_recommended, hours, user_id, review_id</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The project was carried out in pairs—more information can be found in the GitHub repository.
			</p>

			<h2>Connection with PostgreSQL</h2>
			<p>
				Initially, all tables were created in PostgreSQL. 
				To perform the queries using Python, it was necessary to create a connection using psycopg2.
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-python">
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2
import pandasql as ps

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host = "localhost", 
    database = "postgres",  
    user = "postgres", 
    password = "senha"
)
			</code></pre>
			</br>

			<h2>Initial steps</h2>
			<p>
				For each of the tables, the data types, number of missing values, and number of unique values were checked.
				Below are some example queries for the Games table:
			</p>
			<pre><code class="language-python">
# data types
query = """
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE 
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' and table_name = 'games'
;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, con = conn)

# number of missing values
query = """
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN app_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_app_id,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN title IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_title,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN date_release IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_date_release,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN win IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_win,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN mac IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_mac,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN linux IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_linux,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN rating IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_rating,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN positive_ratio IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_positive_ratio,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN user_reviews IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_user_reviews,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN price_final IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS null_price_final
FROM games; 
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, con = conn)

# number of unique values
query = """
SELECT
    COUNT (DISTINCT title) AS unique_title,
    COUNT (DISTINCT date_release) AS unique_date_release,
    COUNT (DISTINCT rating) AS unique_rating
FROM games;
"""
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, con = conn)
			</code></pre>
			</br>

			<h2>Data analysis</h2>
			<p>
				To better understand the data, some questions were posed:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are the 5 most expensive games and when were they released? If the games have the same price, order them by the oldest release date.</li>
			</ul>
				<pre><code class="language-python">
query = """

	title, date_release, price_final
FROM games
ORDER BY price_final DESC, date_release ASC
