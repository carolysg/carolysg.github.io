			<h2>About the project</h2>
			<p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/thumbs/pinguins.png" alt=""></span>
				This is a personal project that involves analyzing a dataset obtained from Kaggle, with the goal of applying the theoretical knowledge acquired from the courses I’m currently taking. The project has three main focuses:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using the Python programming language for data manipulation and processing</li>
				<li>Performing basic analyses on the processed data</li>
				<li>Gaining deeper knowledge of machine learning techniques</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The dataset provides information about penguin species. There are 344 observations and 8 variables:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>species: the species of the penguin, which can be Adelie, Gentoo or Chinstrap</li>
				<li>island: the island where the penguin is found, which can be Torgersen, Biscoe or Dream</li>
				<li>bill_length_mm: the length of the penguin's bill in millimeters</li>
				<li>bill_depth_mm: the depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters</li>
				<li>flipper_length_mm: the length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters</li>
				<li>body_mass_g: the body mass of the penguin in grams</li>
				<li>sex: whether the penguin is male or female</li>
				<li>year: the year the data was collected (2007, 2008 or 2009)</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Etapas iniciais -->
			<h2>Initial steps</h2>
			<p> 
				The first step was to import the necessary libraries, open the CSV file, and check how the data looked. 
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_01.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p> Some of the data treatments performed during this initial stage included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Removing the first column of the dataset</li>
				<li>Checking the data types of the variables</li>
				<li>Treating missing numerical values (bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g): missing values were filled with the average values of penguins from the same species</li>
				<li>Treating missing values in the sex category: a decision tree model was applied to predict the sex of the penguins based on the other variables</li>
			</ul>

			<p> With the dataset cleaned and preprocessed, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process was initiated.</p>

			<!-- Análise exploratória -->
			<h2>
				Exploratory data analysis
			</h2>
			<p>
				The first step was to check the descriptive statistics of the numerical variables. The mean and median values of all variables are relatively close, possibly indicating symmetric distributions.
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_02.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>
				From there, some proportion analyses were conducted. The first analyses involved the distribution of penguins by species, by island, and by sex. Several considerations and questions were raised from the graphical analysis:
			</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_03.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Most of the penguins belong to the Adelie species (44%).</li>
				<li>Most of the penguins are found on Biscoe Island (49%).</li>
				<li>Penguins are equally split between males and females.</li>
				<li>The species proportions are similar to the proportions of penguins on the islands.</li>
				<li>What will be the species proportions on each island?</li>
				<li>What will be the male and female proportions by species? And by island?</li>
				<li>What are the yearly proportions?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To answer these questions, other graphs were created:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_04.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Torgersen Island is inhabited exclusively by Adelie penguins.</li>
				<li>Adelie penguins inhabit all three islands.</li>
				<li>Gentoo penguins inhabit only Biscoe Island and make up 74% of the penguins there.</li>
				<li>Chinstrap penguins inhabit only Dream Island and make up 55% of the penguins there.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_05.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Torgersen Island, inhabited exclusively by Adelie penguins, has a majority of female penguins (52%).</li>
				<li>Biscoe and Dream Islands, although inhabited by two different penguin species, have an (almost) equal proportion of males and females.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_06.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>All species have almost the same number of males and females.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Yearly analyses were also performed:</p>
			<ul>
				Biscoe Island:
				<li>From 2007 to 2008, there was an increase in the number of penguin records for both species.</li>
				<li>From 2008 to 2009, the number of records decreased but remained above the 2007 levels.</li>
				Dream Island:
				<li>Unlike Biscoe Island, the numbers for both species decreased from 2007 to 2008.</li>
				<li>From 2008 to 2009, there was an increase, with the numbers returning close to the 2007 levels.</li>
				Torgersen Island:
				<li>From 2007 to 2008, the number of Adelie penguin records decreased.</li>
				<li>This number remained the same in 2008 and 2009.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> In addition, the characteristics of each species were evaluated using boxplots:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_07.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>The Gentoo species appears to be larger than the other two, with heavier penguins and longer flippers, as well as long but narrow bills.</li>
				<li>The Adelie and Chinstrap species have similar body weights and bill depths, but Chinstrap penguins have longer bills and flippers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Some visualizations were also created to understand the correlation between the variables:</p>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_08.png" alt="" /></span>
			<span class="image fit no-overlay"><img src="images/projetos/pinguins/03_09.png" alt="" /></span>
			<ul>
				<li>Most of the variables exhibit distributions similar to a normal distribution, though narrower.</li>
				<li>Apparently, considering all penguin species, the variables for body weight and flipper length have the highest correlation.</li>
				<li>All the correlation matrices are different, indicating that each penguin species has its own particularities regarding the analyzed characteristics.</li>
				<li>Looking at each species separately, the highest correlation occurs between body weight and flipper length in the Gentoo species (0.72).</li>
				<li>The highest overall correlation occurs between body weight and flipper length when considering all species (0.87). In other words, the heavier the penguin, the longer its flipper tends to be.</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Redes neurais -->
			</br>
			<h2>Neural networks</h2>
			<p>
				A neural network model was developed with the goal of classifying the penguin species based on the bill length and depth, flipper length, and body mass. Some of the main characteristics and results of the model are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The network architecture consists of 3 layers: an input layer (size 4), a hidden layer (size 10), and an output layer (size 3).</li>
				<li>The ReLU activation function was used.</li>
				<li>Cross-entropy loss was used as the evaluation criterion, and the Adam algorithm was used for optimization.</li>
				<li>The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing.</li>
				<li>The model achieved an accuracy of 95%.</li>
			</ul>
